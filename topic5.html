                    <h4>The Weeknd</h4>
                    <p>Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and record producer. Known for his sonic versatility and dark lyricism, his music explores escapism, romance, and melancholia, and is often inspired by personal experiences. He has received numerous accolades, including four Grammy Awards, 19 Billboard Music Awards, 15 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and an Academy Award nomination.<br><br>
                    He calls himself The Weeknd because he dropped out of high school and left home when he was 17 years old. He and his friend (Lamar) just left one weekend and didn’t look back! That’s when he tried “The Weeknd” out as a stage name because he didn’t like his real name at the time and he had to drop the E because there was already a Canadian band going by The Weekend. The artist started his musical career uploading songs to YouTube, until a producer discovered it and took him to the commercial circuit. That's how he became the superstar he is today. Currently, the Canadian singer has his own record label, XO, which makes him feel free to do whatever he wants.<br><br>
                    The discography of Canadian singer-songwriter the Weeknd consists of five studio albums, three mixtapes, two extended plays, three compilation albums (including two greatest hits albums), sixty-one singles (including nineteen as a featured artist), and six promotional singles. The reason I like The Weeknd and his music because he has a mysterious image around him and his music and songwriting is really good. The Weeknd is one of the best singers in the world. He has always been on top ever since he hit the music industry with his melodious voice and meaningful lyrics. He has poured his life into music and he knows how to be a superstar. He keeps his life private and that I think shows how dedicated he is to music.
